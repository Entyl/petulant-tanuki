# File System
This simple two-level directory file system with a block size of 512 bytes was built using FUSE as a final project.  &nbsp;
My file system would mount at a directory and then faux as root while accessing files inside of it.  &nbsp;
Before writing this project I was indifferent to C.  &nbsp;
However, after finishing this project I really grew to like C because of how exciting it was to actually get my favorite bare-bones text editor, nano, to create, open and save a new file using my file system.  &nbsp;
Disclaimer: I am not sure if this code will work with multiple blocks because I ran out of time to test files larger than 512 bytes.  &nbsp;
Also, this code will not compile or run by itself so it is just example of my C code.
